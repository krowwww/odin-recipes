    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) can fully cooked luncheon meat (such as SPAM®), cubed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 cups leftover cooked rice</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen peas and carrots</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon Sriracha (Optional)</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon shredded nori, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sliced scallions, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black sesame seeds, or to taste (Optional)/li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add Spam and fry until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Heat sesame oil in the same pan until shimmering, about 1 minute. Add onion and sauté until it softens slightly, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat and add rice and frozen vegetables; mix and fry until heated through, about 5 minutes. Push rice mixture to the sides or edges of the pan, add beaten eggs to the center, and scramble until curds form, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir half of the Spam back into the pan and mix eggs in with the rest of the rice mixture. Add soy sauce and Sriracha. Mix and remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Crack remaining eggs into a skillet over medium heat. Cook until outer edges become opaque, about 1 minute. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until whites are completely set, about 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place fried eggs on top of the fried rice, add reserved Spam; garnish with nori, scallions, and sesame seeds.</li>
    </ol>
